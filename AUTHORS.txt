If you're not mentioned above but would like to be, please contact me.

Part of the comint integration was lightly taken from `haskell-mode`,
which has been contributed to by many people over the years.

A very special thanks must go to Sean Weaver and Galois Inc. Thanks to them, I
was graciously provided an up-to-date Cryptol license, allowing development of
new features for cryptol-mode, supporting both the commercial and academic
communities. Their contributions have been invaluable.
